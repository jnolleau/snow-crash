Ok !
We have here two files a bin level09 and a file named token

The level08 binary seems to be a simple reader
It can read a file created in /tmp AND the token file:
but no mater there is on the file, the output ob ./level09 is the same
The output seems to depends on the file name, thus:
token --> tpmhr
/tmp/f/file --> /uos3k5mquo
aaaa --> abcd
abc --> ace

The bin level09 seems to be an encoder, which add the position number of a character
to the character in a string
a becomes a in pos 0
a becomes b in pos 1
etc.

with a simple C code decoce.c coded on my host, I reverse the code !

Before that a copied the token file from the vm to my host by:
scp -Cv -P 4242 level09@172.16.254.130:token .
then
chmod 666 token 

pw decoded: f3iji1ju5yuevaus41q1afiuq

dadada !
