This home contains a level02 file
this is an exec file with suid for flag03 user and a sgid for level03 group

-rwsr-sr-x 1 flag03  level03 8627 Mar  5  2016 level03

the s lowecase means that this is an executable file
(in contrary to S Uppercase)

It means that the program is executed by flag03 user,
even if it is run by level03 user

Maybe we can use this program to run the ´getflag´ command ??

How to do that ?
See: https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/command-injection/
Part Example 3

Using ltrace ./level03, we can see than the program calls the echo bin:
¨system("/usr/bin/env echo Exploit me"Exploit me¨

If we create a new ¨echo¨ binary which executes the cmde ¨getflag¨
and we modify the $PATH in order to the level03 bin to execute OUR ¨echo¨,
it should work

thus we know in subject that we can use /tmp or /var/tmp to store some file,
Indeed: d-wx-wx-wx  5 root root  100 May 11 00:32 tmp/

We cannot write into /tmp directly but we can mkdir into it
lets create a test directory into /tmp
lets create a test.c file into /tmp/test containing 

int main(void)
{
	system("getflag");
	return (0);
}

Then we compile with gcc test.c - o echo

We modify the $PATH adding /tmp/test ad its beginning

Then ./level03

Dadada !
