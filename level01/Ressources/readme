ONe first thing to do is to watch in /ect/passwd file to check if pw are not written
We find all the user levelXX without there pw except for flag01 !

BUT it seems encrypted

=> first tried with decode.fr but no result
=> Then crack with john

To use John:
- Use docker to install a Linux version with john available: fedora
=> ENter the command: docker run -it --rm fedora /bin/bash
- Inside the container, enter:
=> yum install john
=> echo flag01:42hDRfypTqqnw > password
=> john password --show
It gives us the cuple login:pw : flag01:abcdefg

Get the token: see flag file
