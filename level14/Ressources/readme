Okay ! No file, no readme...
After some times finding nothing, I found a tip: look at the getflag binary !!

ltrace and strace are not instructive

Lets run:
    gdb getflag
    disas main
We see that there is a LOT of instructions
but we can see ptrace (0x08048989) and getuid (0x08048afd)

Juste after the ptrace we can see a test (90x0804898e).
Soon after the ptrace we can see jmp to the end of the program.
Thus value of eax must be tested and jump according to instructions

Lets see the value of eax step by step from the ptrace (0x08048989)
    b *0x08048989
    run
    display $eax --> 0
    ni
    display $eax --> -1
    continue --> END OF program
So Lets try to modify the eax value juste after ptrace (at test: 0x0804898e)
    set $eax=0
    continue --> END of program but with mention "Nope there is no token here for you sorry. Try again :)"

It means that we have tested to display the flag but stoped because our wrong uid

Lets add a breakpoint juste after the getuid, at line 0x08048b02
    b *0x08048b02
    continue
    display $eax --> 2014

The value 2014 is the uid of level14
We know that the uid of flag14 is 3014 (see /etc/passwd)
Thus lets chnage the value of eax
    set $eax=3014
    continue

DADADA !!!!!

token is: 7QiHafiNa3HVozsaXkawuYrTstxbpABHD8CPnHJ

dadada !

See flag in flag file


Here is the copy of the gdb screen with all the commands:
(The commands entered ar only the lines with "(gdb)" before)

========================
(gdb) b *0x08048989
Breakpoint 1 at 0x8048989
(gdb) run
Starting program: /bin/getflag 

Breakpoint 1, 0x08048989 in main ()
(gdb) display $eax
1: $eax = 0
(gdb) ni
0x0804898e in main ()
1: $eax = -1
(gdb) set $eax=0
(gdb) b *0x08048b02
Breakpoint 2 at 0x8048b02
(gdb) continue
Continuing.

Breakpoint 2, 0x08048b02 in main ()
1: $eax = 2014
(gdb) set $eax=3014
(gdb) continue
Continuing.
Check flag.Here is your token : 7QiHafiNa3HVozsaXkawuYrTstxbpABHD8CPnHJ
[Inferior 1 (process 2801) exited normally]
