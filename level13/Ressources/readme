we have 1 file:
- the binary level13
When we exec it, we have
UID 2013 started us but we we expect 4242

ltrace ./level13 

So the bin uses the function getuid()

INDEED, lets use gdb to Check

gdb ./level13
(gdb) disas main

line 4:  0x08048595 <+9>:	call   0x8048380 <getuid@plt>

Then there is a comparison between eax and 0x1092 (4242 in hex)
Lets displau eax content:


(gdb) display $eax
1: $eax = 2013

Lets modify eax content:
(gdb) set $eax = 4242
(gdb) n
Single stepping until exit from function main,
which has no line number information.
your token is 2A31L79asukciNyi8uppkEuSx
0xb7e454d3 in __libc_start_main () from /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6
1: $eax = 40

We have our token !



token is: 2A31L79asukciNyi8uppkEuSx which is the flag

dadada !
